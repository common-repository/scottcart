ScottCart is a powerful free WordPress eCommerce plugin that helps you sell anything, anywhere. Official PayPal Partner.

== Description ==

ScottCart is a free WordPress eCommerce plugin that allows you to sell anything, anywhere. Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, ScottCart is the first WordPress eCommerce shopping cart that looks great right out of the box. So there is no need to spend days customizing it.

= Sell Anything, Anywhere =

With ScottCart, you can sell physical, digital, or service products. Add product variations, images, and downloads options for your customers. You can even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.

Scott comes with 27 built in currencies, so you can sell anywhere.

With premium extensions, the possibilities are endless. Perhaps you'd like to accept credit cards directly on your site, or even start selling your own software? Anything is possible.

= Ship Anywhere =
Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time shipping calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the entire world.

= Payment Options =
ScottCart comes with PayPal Standard built in, so you can start accepting all major Credit Cards and PayPal accounts immediately. We offer other gateway extensions on our website such as Stripe for processing credit cards directly on your site.

= Inventory Management =
You can configure ScottCart to reduce the inventory quantity of your physical or digital product whenever it sells.

= Graphs and Reports =
With built in beautiful reports and graphs you can see all of your sales and numbers in one place. Get to understand your customers behavior and make smart decisions.

= You own your data =
One of the biggest risks and problems of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With ScottCart, you have complete control over all of your data. Your data belongs to you.

= Does the plugin use pages? =
When this plugin is installed it automatically created 5 pages. The Shop, Cart, Account, Order Cancelled, and Purchase Confirmation pages.

Create a product on the Products page.

= Can I view my orders inside the WordPress dashboard? =
Yes, When someone purchases your product, you will be able to see their order on the Orders page.

= Is an SSL certificate required? =	
ScottCart can function without one just fine, making it easy to set up in a testing or development environment. We still strongly recommend you have an SSL certificate for your production web site, both for security and for the peace of mind of your customers.

= What themes work with Easy Digital Downloads? =
Any properly written theme will work with ScottCart.

= Getting a 404 error? =
To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a product, you need to resave your permalink structure. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes".

= Orders placed through PayPal not showing in the admin =
If you are using a firewall that is blocking PayPal.com, that can cause this issue. Also if your WordPress is installed in a different folder then this issue you can happen. Please contact us if you continue to have problems.
